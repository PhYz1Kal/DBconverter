## Platforms
Well, as a beginner i couldn't create an algorithm to get the system path to save the files, so this app is only available for the **Raspberry Pi**.
## Installation 
First of all download the zip folder, then extract the content into the Desktop. Go into the **dbconv_data** folder and run the file **install.sh**. The last step is to move the **dbconv_data** folder into `/home/pi/`. And it's done! Start the launcher on the file to launch the app.
## Basic Usage
when you start the app you can see this

Just type in the box and you will automatically have a conversion, nothing easier.

To create a new tab: **File>New**

To open a conversion file you got: **File>Open**. Browse your file and double click it.

To save the conversion as a text file **File>Save as txt**

To close the app: **File>Exit**


To generate a conversion file to share: **Tools>Generate conv file**


To report a bug: **Help>Bug Report**. A browser window will open, click on the highlited label and you should have an email application opening with a formatted email. write the content and possibly add some images so i can understand better. Thank you
## Uninstall
To remove all the files just head into the terminal and type `./home/pi/dbconv_data/uninstall.sh`.
